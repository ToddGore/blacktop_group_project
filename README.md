Blacktop Group Project

Erik Amundson: Worked on back-end setting up the database schemas and the controllers to retrieve the data from the data base tables. Worked on the Listing and Checkout component.

Blake Rindlisbacher: I was over some of the front end work and all of the CSS. This app allows you to rent out your extra parking spaces for people to park in. Whether that would be a driveway or a large parking lot for events. Logging in is done with Auth0. This is the main home page. Here you can search for available parking spots using the Google Maps API. Also navigate throughout the website. Post a parking lot listing for view upcoming reservations. This is the my vehicles page. I did most of the front end work for this page. Here you can add a vehicle to your account. Letting other users know what vehicle should be in their parking spot. This page has full CRUD and we are using a Heroku database to pull data from.

Katrina Fairfax: The Blacktop features I was tasked with implementing were Google Maps Javascript API, Geocoder, Redux, and Auth0 authentication. I developed My Listing, Wizard pages 0-9, and the Edit Listing page. The react-google-maps library was used to import React components with which the Google Maps Javascript API instances were wrapped. The toughest feature of Google Maps to implement was the Standalone Search Box. Geocoder conveniently converted string typed addresses into latitude and longitude, so that they could be stored as markers on the map. Redux was used to magage state for the My Listigs Wizards,etc., so that selections could be tracked when clicking back to review selected answers. My Listings is full CRUD.
